# Hersh Kumar

## About Me
Hello! My name is Hersh Kumar and I am a first year Physics graduate student at the University of Maryland.

My interests mainly lie in quantum computation, nuclear theory, and computational physics. I am currently working on the digital quantum simulation of scattering processes. I have previously worked on the use of neural networks as variational ansatze for many-body bosonic and fermionic systems, as well as digital quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories.

### Selected Papers
- We propose neural network variational ansatze for bosonic and fermionic many-body quantum systems, and apply our networks to several analytic and non-analytic models:
    - [Neural network solutions of bosonic quantum systems in one dimension](https://journals.aps.org/prc/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevC.109.034004) 
    - [A Machine Learning Approach to Trapped Many-Fermion Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17383)
- We produce an estimate of the entangling gate cost for the simulation of lattice gauge theories on quantum computers: 
    - [How many quantum gates do gauge theories require?](https://journals.aps.org/prd/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevD.106.094504)

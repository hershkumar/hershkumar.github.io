title: Notes
---
Over the years I've written up notes for some of the physics courses that I've taken, and so I'm posting them all here, in an effort to put them all in one place.
While the total number of courses I've taken notes for is much larger than shown below, these are the notes that I would consider helpful to someone taking a similar course, while others are disorganized, stop halfway (or earlier) in a course, or suffer from other flaws that I haven't bothered fixing. Also note that many of these courses are taught differently semester to semester, so they may be structured differently.

Please note that there may be some (severe) typos, so if in doubt about a formula or equation, please reference a textbook. If you do find a typo, please send me an email at `hekumar@umd.edu`, and I'll fix it as soon as possible.
